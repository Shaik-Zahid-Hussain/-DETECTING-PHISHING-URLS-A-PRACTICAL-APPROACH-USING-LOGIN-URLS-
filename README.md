 DETECTING PHISHING URLS: A PRACTICAL APPROACH USING LOGIN URLS 
🚀 Project Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project for the practical detection of phishing URLs, with a specific emphasis on those that mimic legitimate login pages. The goal of this project is to build a robust and effective classification system that can analyze a given URL and determine whether it is a legitimate site or a fraudulent phishing attempt.

The project pipeline covers the entire process from raw data to a trained, evaluated model. Key steps include:

Data Collection: Gathering datasets of phishing and benign URLs from reputable sources.

Feature Engineering: Extracting meaningful characteristics from each URL, such as lexical, domain-based, and content-based features.

Model Training: Training and evaluating multiple machine learning models to find the most effective solution.

Performance Analysis: A final review of model performance to select the best classifier.

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need Python 3.8+ and the libraries listed in requirements.txt.

Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/Shaik-Zahid-Hussain/DETECTING-PHISHING-URLS.git
cd DETECTING-PHISHING-URLS


Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


(Optional) Explore the notebooks/ directory to see the data analysis and model development process.

Running the Project
You can run the full pipeline from the command line:

# Example command to run the main script (replace with your actual script name)
python src/main.py


This command will handle data loading, feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation.

🧠 Methodology
Our approach is based on supervised learning. We use a dataset of known phishing and benign URLs to train a classifier. The features we extract include, but are not limited to:

Lexical Features: URL length, use of special characters, presence of IP addresses.

Domain-based Features: Age of the domain, domain registration information.

Content-based Features (for login URLs): Presence of specific keywords, use of HTTPS.

We will explore a range of models, such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forests, to find the best-performing one.
